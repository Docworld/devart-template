I've started writing the section of the Plus Point app which will record the vistors message to be stored in their digital signature. This uses a simple graphical feedback to their voice's amplitude as they talk and let them know the audio's being recorded. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/SeanJD/devart-template/tree/master/project_code/PlusPoint/AIR)

The app version uses the microphone input as the audio source. In order to turn the byte stream from the mic into usable data I had to process it to extract its amplitude component. I did this using a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm I found after a quick search. You can view the author's source [here](http://gerrybeauregard.wordpress.com/2010/08/03/an-even-faster-as3-fft/)

For the video example below I'm actually playing a [BoC](http://www.discogs.com/Boards-Of-Canada-The-Campfire-Headphase/master/2141) track through it just to demo the graphics reacting to real-time audio (believe me, it sounds better than my voice!)

I compiled the app into an apk file and recorded through adb screenrecord. You can download the apk file [here](ftp://seanclusta@win9.pipeten.co.uk/seanclusta/seanduffy.pipeten.co.uk/diffeng/vox/PlusPoint.apk). The assets in the apk are fixed for a Nexus5 resolution (FullHD) so it won't scale on any other device at the moment.
