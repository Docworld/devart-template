I've started writing the section of the Plus Point app which will record the vistors message to be stored in their digital signature. This uses a simple graphical feedback to their voice's amplitude as they talk and let them know the audio's being recorded. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/SeanJD/devart-template/tree/master/project_code/PlusPoint/AIR)

The app version uses the microphone input as the audio source, but for the recorded example below I'm loading and playing a [BoC](http://www.discogs.com/Boards-Of-Canada-The-Campfire-Headphase/master/2141) track just to demonstrate the realtime audio playback in action (believe me, it sounds better than my voice!)

I compiled the app into an apk file and recorded through adb screenrecord. You can download the apk file [here](ftp://seanclusta@win9.pipeten.co.uk/seanclusta/seanduffy.pipeten.co.uk/diffeng/vox/PlusPoint.apk). The assets in the apk are fixed for a Nexus5 resolution (FullHD) so it won't scale on any other device at the moment.
