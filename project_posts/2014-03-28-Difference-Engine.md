Time's run out! 

We feel we've added a lot over the last couple of weeks but there's a whole lot more we would like to show here if we had time (especially with the engine and effects animations).

Instead of driving forward with the core app we wanted to focus on proof of concept for each technical element, once the unknown & risky bits are out the way it's just a matter of filling in  the finer brush strokes. 


The core frameworks are now in place and tested for our purpose. There's the android-based contactless heart rate recording, the voice recording and processing (vox), the multiple output windows each driven from a different camera rendering from the main scene & the 3D engine which will hold several thousand unique particles and animations. 

We're now at the point where we can build on this and start really playing with the materials, shaders and sound fx to see the types of wraparound 3D data visualisations we can produce....
