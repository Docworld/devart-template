For the contactless heart rate extraction I am using a library written for android by Portuguese developer Pedro Chambino. It's based on a technique called 'Eulerian Video Magnification' developed and open sourced by MIT in 2012. Pedro has adapted this for smartphones, it uses video from the device's camera along with magnification and signal/image processing to calculate changes in skin colour caused by blood flow. These changes are imperceptible to the naked eye but can be extracted by this technique to calculate a person's pulse and heart rate.

The library uses native (c++) code to implement the technique at reasonable speeds on mobile, this is compiled into the app using the android NDK. 
A detailed process for setting up the library and publishing on Windows can be found [here](http://seanduffy.pipeten.co.uk/diffeng/pulseintegration.txt).

After some configurations I now have the app up and running and it seems to be very accurate whilst working. The app uses OpenCV to recognise and track the user's face. When locked on, if the image is still enough the processing extracts the pulse information. There are some stability issues but they seem to be due to lighting and stillness (it's much more stable under bright controlled lighting, and when both the device and the face are still).

I plan to contact the developer and see whether the code variables can be tweaked to make the app more stable (perhaps as a tradeoff to accuracy) as I think this will be important to get a long enough reading.
